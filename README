This is a project designed to mine and analyze the MyERAS failure/outage
assocaited with the 2015 application cycle as manifested on Twitter.

At present, my intent is to download and examine the #ERAS and #ERAS2015
hashtags, looking at what was said, when, by whom, and what their relationships
are.
